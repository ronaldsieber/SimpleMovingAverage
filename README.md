# SimpleMovingAverage

This project includes two implementations of the Simple Moving Average algorithm:

- C++ Template Class (-> `SimpleMovingAverage.hpp`)
- Embedded C (-> `SimpleMovingAverage.c` / `SimpleMovingAverage.h`)

The file `Main.cpp` shows how to use both implementation variants.

The following two charts illustrates the effect of the Sample Window Size. They each show the moving average output for the Data Series `aiDataSeries_g[]`, defined in `Main.cpp`.
